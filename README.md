# Job Finder ðŸ’»

This is a React Native app built using the Expo package with Expo Router. I used the Jobicy free API to get the job data.
[Jobicy API](https://jobicy.com/)

For information on how to use the API, you can check the usage on 
[Jobicy API Instructions](https://rapidapi.com/jobicy-jobicy-default/api/jobicy)

```
API Query Parameters (optional)
count - Number of listings to return (default: 50, range: 1-50)
geo - Filter by job region (default: all regions)
industry - Filter by job category (default: all categories)
tag - Search by job title and description (default: all jobs)

Eg: https://jobicy.com/api/v2/remote-jobs?count=20&geo=usa&industry=marketing&tag=seo
```

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
